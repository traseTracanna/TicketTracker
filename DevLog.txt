*** Ticket Tracker Project Devlog ***

1/3/23:
    Started the project today. Spent about 90 minutes or so outlining the scope of the project and some semblance of a todo list on how to make the project.

    My plan is to start with the front end first and then do backend. 

    Ultimately my goal for this project is to be as fully fleshed out as it can be in a reasonable amount of time and to have it deployed.

    After making the project outline, this may be a pretty big project that will take me some time, but inexperience makes it hard for me to guage exactly how long that will be.
        Another layer of complexity to this is that I would like to try to implement some new technology that i'm only vaguely familiar with like OAuth and MVC.

        I'm hopeful that by doing a decent amount of planning ahead of time, and by tracking my progress in this devlog that I will be able to complete it. 
    
    All this being said, my hope is to have this project finished by end-of-day 1/22/23.
        This is something like 20 full days i think? 
            Assuming it will be a project that takes 100 hours, that's 5 hours of work per day every day. 

        I think it's unrealistic to think I will actually work on this every single day, as i usually take weekends off from coding, but I'm thinking as the
        deadline approaches i will increase my average daily hours of work. 
            But as for now, 5 hours per day every weekday is acceptably manageable. 

        I also think it's important for me to keep in mind that for my faux-store app, frontend took significantly longer than backend.
            This is likely attributable to it being longer since i worked with front end stuff, but i have a feeling that puzzling out functionality of this app on the frontend
            will take longer than getting it to all connect to the db and server. 
                That being said, I should ensure that I allow myself a generous amount of time to work on the backend at the end of this project, and keep in mind that I will also need
                to figure out finalized design work, optimization, api documentation, and deployment -- all things I haven't interfaced with very much.

        More than anything else, it's important to keep in mind during this project not to despair if i'm not meeting my timeline benchmarks.
            If i fall into this bad habit it will likely demotivate me to actually work on this which will only exasperate the issue.

    Finally, my goals for tomorrow are:
        1) Have some outlines of how each page of the app will look in order to direct development 
        2) Create the frontend file architecture, taking into account redux slices and react components. 
    If I can accomplish these tasks tomorrow, on 1/5 I should be able to start actually writing code.
