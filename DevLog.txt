*** Ticket Tracker Project Devlog ***

1/3/23:
    Started the project today. Spent about 90 minutes or so outlining the scope of the project and some semblance of a todo list on how to make the project.

    My plan is to start with the front end first and then do backend. 

    Ultimately my goal for this project is to be as fully fleshed out as it can be in a reasonable amount of time and to have it deployed.

    After making the project outline, this may be a pretty big project that will take me some time, but inexperience makes it hard for me to guage exactly how long that will be.
        Another layer of complexity to this is that I would like to try to implement some new technology that i'm only vaguely familiar with like OAuth and MVC.

        I'm hopeful that by doing a decent amount of planning ahead of time, and by tracking my progress in this devlog that I will be able to complete it. 
    
    All this being said, my hope is to have this project finished by end-of-day 1/22/23.
        This is something like 20 full days i think? 
            Assuming it will be a project that takes 100 hours, that's 5 hours of work per day every day. 

        I think it's unrealistic to think I will actually work on this every single day, as i usually take weekends off from coding, but I'm thinking as the
        deadline approaches i will increase my average daily hours of work. 
            But as for now, 5 hours per day every weekday is acceptably manageable. 

        I also think it's important for me to keep in mind that for my faux-store app, frontend took significantly longer than backend.
            This is likely attributable to it being longer since i worked with front end stuff, but i have a feeling that puzzling out functionality of this app on the frontend
            will take longer than getting it to all connect to the db and server. 
                That being said, I should ensure that I allow myself a generous amount of time to work on the backend at the end of this project, and keep in mind that I will also need
                to figure out finalized design work, optimization, api documentation, and deployment -- all things I haven't interfaced with very much.

        More than anything else, it's important to keep in mind during this project not to despair if i'm not meeting my timeline benchmarks.
            If i fall into this bad habit it will likely demotivate me to actually work on this which will only exasperate the issue.

    Finally, my goals for tomorrow are:
        1) Have some outlines of how each page of the app will look in order to direct development 
        2) Create the frontend file architecture, taking into account redux slices and react components. 
    If I can accomplish these tasks tomorrow, on 1/5 I should be able to start actually writing code.


1/4/23:
    Just finished all of the basic page layouts to help me determine what the file architecture of the app will look like. 
        Next I need to actually do that work -- figure out what the react components and redux slices are going to be and how to organize them. 
        I feel compelled to do some reading on the purpose of each of those things though before i dive right in so i'm not making things redundant while leaving other things out.
        It would help to define what a react component and redux slice is I suppose to help me determine which thing is which on the webpage, and maybe help to make more generic
        types of each that can more easily be recycled throughout the code like the way pages are listed for tickets/projects or the way comments and assigned users are displayed.
        
        On top of all that I feel like I should brush up on MVC right away as well to make sure the way i'm designing my frontend won't screw me over later as i try to connect
        the backend through mvc.

    I didn't do as much today as I could have, and my future self will probably lament me for that,
        But i basically just spent time trying to understand the react-redux library. I've got most of a grasp on it, but will likely have to take more notes tomorrow as found in
        UnderstandingNewTech.txt 
        I will also have to take a look at the MVC stuff tomorrow as well, and finally figure out how to best use redux slices and react components to organize my program.
        It's probably best I continue to take my time with the actual setup of this project instead of getting antsy and rushing into things so that development goes as smoothly
        as possible. 
    
    The good news is I at least took the time to wire frame all pages of my app which will help guide me in my file architecture tomorrow.

    My goals for tomorrow are:
        1) Fully understand the react-redux toolkit to the best of my ability
        2) Understand how MVC will work within my system
        3) Outline the react components and redux slices in relation to the functions of my program.
        4) Create the project files i think i'll need. 


1/5/2023:
    I've done more research this morning about the functions of MVC and redux and have decided that because of the way MVC increases complexity of structure for the sake of 
    simplifying changing the way a particular system within an application works over time, that it may not best suit my needs for this project and cause more of a headache than
    what it's worth to try and implement right now. I feel that the MVC system is good to keep in mind for if I were ever working on a project with a team of people, but these
    independent solo projects are probably not the right time to try to throw it in. 
        This is somewhat of a relief as it means there's one less thing I have to tackle during my development of this project. 

    One other thing that is coming to me today is that this will likely take longer than I expect. My goal is to have this project done by EOD 1/22, but at the rate i'm starting off here'
    I don't exactly have high hopes that this is a realistic expectation. Regardless I will still try to push to finish this as fast as I can manage and try to prevent dispairing if that
    takes longer than i'm hoping for, but I think i'm already feeling kind of burnt out on this whole project. 
        Hopefully these feelings of doubt will subside a bit once I actually get the project rolling. It's been a slow start and I think it's mostly cause i'm nervous about where
        I'm going to start, and being worried about having my project structured in a way I will come to regret later. The key may be to just develop a plan, and stick to it
        for as long as it can work, and then just get hacky from there.

    Next on the docket for today is trying to framework the react and redux pieces of the puzzle and how they will fit together.

    I think i've made some solid progress so far on defining the state of the application through the components that each page will need. 
    This project definitely feels complex, but I still think it is manageable.
    One thing that has come to mind, however, is I feel i may need to go ahead and create the structure of the database right away to help when I work on front end.
    I just want to make sure that as i'm developing front-end features, I include spaces in the code where server calls are going to be so that I don't accidentally update the 
    store instance without updating data in the db 
        For instance, if i add a new user to a project, I need to make sure to update both the project's info and the user's info in the db. This can be done in one server call,
        but i think it's important for me to mark out where this happens in the code so i don't end up missing something a few weeks from now.


1/6/23:
    Again, I haven't really gotten around to much today as I am still intimidated about the architecture of this project and the efficiency of doing it well. 
    I created the react app with redux support or whatever, and have started making all the folders and files i think will be necessary for this project.
    The two pieces I've continued to avoid however are
        1) login -- mostly because it seems like something that won't matter right off the gate of getting this thing to function,
            but also because i don't really know how Oauth and cookies work so i'm puting it off for now
        2) Users -- mostly because i don't really know how i'm going to handle user continuity after login, and because i'm not convinced my outlining on having both an
            allUsers slice and a thisUser slice to be the best way to do it. 
    Other than that, the architecture does still feel a bit messy, but I think i just have to commit, send it, accept that i'm going to make some mistakes here and aim to learn from
    them after the fact. 
        I could always refactor later, but I know that the messier the web of hacky code gets, the more daunting this will be further down the line. So maybe for now i just say fuckit
        and focus on making a working product without worrying too much about this mysterious 'perfect way' of doing it that I don't know of or haven't thought of yet.
        To at least be fair to myself, the organization I've done over the past 4 days of this project will help me monumentally compared to when i made the ecommerce full stack app,
        where I went in with basically no plan and still somehow got something together in 3 weeks. 
            This project is a bit more ambitious than that one, but i think the groundwork i've already laid for myself will prove to be helpful even if it is not perfect. 
    
    I think my immediate goal should be to
        1) Make some fake local project, ticket, and user data to load into the store
        2) Develop selectors to acquire the data corresponding to the correct user
        3) Design the components and logic necessary to display the data in the dataList formats
         - Maybe don't necessarily get stun locked in making the multiple-pages thing work right away if it proves to cause issue
        4) Implement the view slice to switch between the two from the NavBar 
        5) Design the components and logic necessary to display project data on the ProjectPage
        6) Design the components and logic necessary to display ticket data on the TicketPage

        Aim to finish this ^ by 1/11 (5 days)

    then from there:
        7) Design update functionality to the data i.e.:
            a) adding users to tickets and projects
            b) creating new tickets and projects
            c) updating ticket priority
            d) adding new comments
            e) deleting/archiving tickets and projects
                - Again, don't need to get too stunlucked on this one either -- can always circle back
        8) Implement user roles 
            a) Add logic for switching things from admin/user view
            b) Add logic for allowing user's to be assigned as Project managers with corresponding functionality 
        9) Implement user creation
            a) OAuth
            b) Cookies for user continuity and how it will affect an admin user viewing a non-admin user's projects/tickets
                - Maybe circle back on this too
        10) Implement the user's page
            a) Determine the usability of allUsers and currentUser slices
            b) Add logic for adding/removing admin controls to a user
            c) Allow an admin to view all of a specific user's projects/tickets
                - No need to get stun locked on this either if it proves to be tricky, just keep pushing 
        11) Implement the home page
            a) Necessary components for displaying data in graph format as desired. 
    And that should cover 95% of front end's necessary features i think.
    I would say from here move on to backend, and anything you skipped over can be circled back on when coming back this way to manage server call implementation.

    Aim to finish this ^ by 1/17 ( 6 days ) 

    This will leave 5 days for back end, including weekends.
